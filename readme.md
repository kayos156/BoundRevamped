# Attention
**This is a WIP Mod of Jcw87's [Bad Time Simulator](https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/), except with harder attacks. The only changes were the attacks, some text, the "Infinite Loop Detected" function, and sprites, which means that you shouldn't be testing your own custom attacks here.**
